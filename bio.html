    <h1 id = header>About Myself</h1>
    <p id = bio> Hi, I'm Conor Gourley. I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, with a minor in Linguistics and a potential minor in Philosophy. I've also taken classes in French since I was five and am currently fluent. I've been rock climbing since I was a child and have competed at many regional and national level events, as well as coached youth teams for four years, and I am currently on the board of the Tufts Climbing Team.</p>
